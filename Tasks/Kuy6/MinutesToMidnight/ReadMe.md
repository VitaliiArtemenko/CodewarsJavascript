<p>Teemo is not really excited about the New Year's Eve, but he has to celebrate it with his friends anyway.</p>
<p>He has a huge passion about programming, and he wants to be productive till midnight. 
He wants to know how many minutes he has left to work on his new project.<br>
He doesn't want to look on the clock all the time, so he thought about a function, which returns him the number of minutes.</p>
<p>Can you write him a function, so he can stay productive?</p>
<p>The function <code>minutesToMidnight(d)</code> will take a date object as parameter. 
Return the number of minutes in the following format:<br><code>"x minute(s)"</code></p>
<h3>Notes:</h3>
<ul>
<li>You will always get a date object with of today with a random timestamp.</li>
<li>You have to round the number of minutes.</li>
<li>Milliseconds doesn't matter!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Examples:</h3>
<pre>
10.00 am => "840 minutes"

23.59 pm => "1 minute"
