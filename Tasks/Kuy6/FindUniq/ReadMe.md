<hr>
<p>There is an array with some numbers. All numbers are equal except for one. Try to find i</p>
<pre>
findUniq([ 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1 ]) === 2
findUniq([ 0, 0, 0.55, 0, 0 ]) === 0.55
</pre>
<p>Itâ€™s guaranteed that array contains at least 3 numbers.</p>
<p>Some tests can be very huge arrays, so think about performance</p>
