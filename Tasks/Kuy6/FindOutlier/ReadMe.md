<h2>6 Kuy</h2>
<hr>
<p>You are given an array (which will have a length of at least 3, but could be very large) 
containing integers. 
The array is either entirely composed of odd integers or entirely composed of even integers 
except for a single integer N. 
Write a method that takes the array as an argument and returns this "outlier" N.</p>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<pre>
[<span style="color: darkorange">2, 4, 0, 100, 4, 11, 2602, 36</span>]
Should <span style="color: purple">return</span>: <span style="color: darkorange">11</span> (the only odd number)

[<span style="color: darkorange">160, 3, 1719, 19, 11, 13, -21</span>]
Should <span style="color: purple">return</span>: <span style="color: darkorange">160</span> (the only even number)
