<p>I love Fibonacci numbers in general, but I must admit I love some more than others.</p>
<p>I would like for you to write me a function that when given a number (n) returns the n-th number in the Fibonacci Sequence.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
   nthFibo(<span style="color: darkorange">4</span>) == <span style="color: darkorange">2</span>
</pre>
<p>Because 2 is the 4th number in the Fibonacci Sequence.</p>
<p>For reference, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.</p>
