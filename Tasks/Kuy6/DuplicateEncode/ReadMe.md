<p>The goal of this exercise is to convert a string to a new string where each character in the new string 
is <code>"("</code> if that character appears only once in the original string, or <code>")"</code> if 
that character appears more than once in the original string. 
Ignore capitalization when determining if a character is a duplicate.</p>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<pre>
"din"      =>  "((("
"recede"   =>  "()()()"
"Success"  =>  ")())())"
"(( @"     =>  "))(("
