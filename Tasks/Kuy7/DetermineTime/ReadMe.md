<h2>7 Kuy</h2>
<hr>
<p>Oh no! Santa's little elves are sick this year. He has to distribute the presents on his own.</p>
<p>But he has only 24 hours left. Can he do it?</p>
<h3>Your Task:</h3>
<p>You will get an array as input with time durations as string 
in the following format: <code>HH:MM:SS</code>. 
Each duration represents the time taken by Santa to deliver a present. 
Determine whether he can do it in 24 hours or not. 
In case the time required to deliver all the presents is exactly 24 hours, 
Santa can complete the delivery ;-) .</p>
