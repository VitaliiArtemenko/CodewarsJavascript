<h2>7 Kuy</h2>
<hr>
<p>Learning to code around your full time job is taking over your life. You realise that in order to make significant steps quickly, it would help to go to a coding bootcamp in London.</p>
<p>Problem is, many of them cost a fortune, and those that don't still involve a significant amount of time off work - who will pay your mortgage?!</p>
<p>To offset this risk, you decide that rather than leaving work totally, you will request a sabbatical so that you can go back to work post bootcamp and be paid while you look for your next role.</p>
<p>You need to approach your boss. Her decision will be based on three parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>val</code> = your value to the organisation</li>
<li><code>happiness</code> = her happiness level at the time of asking and finally</li>
<li>the numbers of letters from 'sabbatical' that are present in string <code>s</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that if <code>s</code> contains three instances of the letter 'l', that still scores three points, even though there is only one in the word sabbatical.</p>
<p>If the sum of the three parameters (as described above) is > 22, 
return <code>'Sabbatical! Boom!'</code>, 
else return <code>'Back to your desk, boy.'</code>.</p>
