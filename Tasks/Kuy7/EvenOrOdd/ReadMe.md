<p>Given a string of digits confirm whether the sum of all the individual even digits are greater than the sum 
of all the individual odd digits. Always a string of numbers will be given.</p>
<p>Expected results:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the sum of even numbers is greater than the odd numbers return: <code>"Even is greater than Odd"</code></li>
<li>If the sum of odd numbers is greater than the sum of even numbers return: <code>"Odd is greater than Even"</code></li>
<li>If the total of both even and odd numbers are identical return: <code>"Even and Odd are the same"</code></li>
</ul>
