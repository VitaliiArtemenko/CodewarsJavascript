<h2>7 Kuy</h2>
<hr>
<p>Consider the word <code>"abode"</code>. We can see that the letter <code>a</code> is in position <code>1</code> 
and <code>b</code> is in position <code>2</code>. In the alphabet, <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are also 
in positions <code>1</code> and <code>2</code>. Notice also that <code>d</code> and <code>e</code> in <code>abode</code> 
occupy the positions they would occupy in the alphabet, which are positions <code>4</code> and <code>5</code>.</p>
<p>Given an array of words, return an array of the number of letters that occupy their positions in the alphabet for each word. 
For example,</p>
<pre>alphabetSymmetry(["abode","ABc","xyzD"]) = [4, 3, 1]</pre>
<p>Input will consist of alphabet characters, both uppercase and lowercase. No spaces.</p>
