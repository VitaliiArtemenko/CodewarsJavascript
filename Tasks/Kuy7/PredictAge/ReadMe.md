<hr>
<p>My grandfather always predicted how old people would get, 
and right before he passed away he revealed his secret!</p>
<p>In honor of my grandfather's memory we will write a function using his formula!</p>
<ul>
<li>Take a list of ages when each of your great-grandparent died.</li>
<li>Multiply each number by itself.</li>
<li>Add them all together.</li>
<li>Take the square root of the result.</li>
<li>Divide by two.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Example:</h3>
<pre>
predictAge(<span style="color: darkorange">65, 60, 75, 55, 60, 63, 64, 45</span>) === <span style="color: darkorange">86</span>
</pre>
<p>Note: the result should be rounded down to the nearest integer.</p>
