<h3>DESCRIPTION:</h3>
<p>You're in ancient Greece and giving Philoctetes a hand in preparing a training exercise for Hercules! 
You've filled a pit with two different ferocious mythical creatures for Hercules to battle!</p>
<p>The formidable <strong>"Orthus"</strong> is a 2-headed dog with 1 tail. 
The mighty <strong>"Hydra"</strong> has 5 heads and 1 tail.</p>
<p>Before Hercules goes in, he asks you "How many of each beast am I up against!?"</p>
<p>You know the total number of heads and the total number of tails, that's the dangerous parts, right? 
But you didn't consider how many of each beast.</p>
<h3>Task</h3>
<p>Given the number of heads and the number of tails, work out the number of each mythical beast!</p>
<p>The data is given as two parameters. Your answer should be returned as an array:</p>
<pre>
 VALID ->      [24 , 15]           INVALID ->  "No solutions"
            [Orthus, Hydra]
</pre>
<p>If there aren't any cases for the given amount of heads and tails - return "No solutions"</p>
