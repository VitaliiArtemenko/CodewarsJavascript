<h2>7 Kuy</h2>
<hr>
<p>Ever the learned traveller, Alan Partridge has pretty strong views on London:</p>
<pre>
"Go to London. I guarantee you'll either be mugged or not appreciated.
Catch the train to London, stopping at Rejection, Disappointment, Backstabbing Central and Shattered Dreams Parkway."
</pre>
<p>Your job is to check that the provided list of stations contains all the stops Alan mentions. 
There will be other stations in the array.</p>
<h3>Example:</h3>
<pre>
['Rejection', 'Disappointment', 'Backstabbing Central', 'Shattered Dreams Parkway']
</pre>
<p>If the stations all appear, return 'Smell my cheese you mother!', 
if not, return 'No, seriously, run. You will miss it. '.</p>
