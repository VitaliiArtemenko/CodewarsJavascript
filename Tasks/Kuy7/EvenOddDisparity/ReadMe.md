<p>Given an array, return the difference between the count of even numbers and the count of odd numbers. 
<code>0</code> will be considered an even number.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>evenOddDisparity([0,1,2,3]) = 0 because there are two even numbers and two odd numbers. Even - Odd = 2 - 2 = 0</pre>
<p>Let's now add two letters to the last example:</p>
<pre></pre>
<pre>evenOddDisparity([0,1,2,3,'a','b']) = 0. Again, Even - Odd = 2 - 2 = 0. Ignore letters. </pre>
<p>The input will be an array of lowercase letters and numbers only.</p>
