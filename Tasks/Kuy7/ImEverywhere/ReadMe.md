<p>Many people know that Apple uses the letter "i" in almost all of its devices to emphasize its personality.</p>

<p>And so John, a programmer at Apple, was given the task of making a program that would add that letter to every word. Let's help him do it, too.</p>

<h3>Task:</h3>

<p>Your task is to make a function that takes the value of <b>word</b> and returns it with an "i" 
at the beginning of the word. For example, we get the word "Phone", so we must return "iPhone". 
But we have a few rules:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>The word should not begin with the letter "I", for example <b>Inspire</b>.</li>
<p><li>The number of vowels should not be greater than or equal to the number of consonants, 
for example <b>East</b> or <b>Peace</b>. ("y" is considered a consonant)</li>
<p><li>The first letter should not be lowercase, for example <b>road</b>.</li>
</ul>
