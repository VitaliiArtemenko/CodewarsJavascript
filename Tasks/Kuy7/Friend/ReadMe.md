<p>Make a program that filters a list of strings and returns a list with only your friends name in it.</p>
<p>If a name has exactly 4 letters in it, you can be sure that it has to be a friend of yours! Otherwise, you can be sure he's not...</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre>
friend [<span style="color: #006600">"Ryan", "Kieran", "Mark"</span>] `shouldBe` [<span style="color: #006600">"Ryan", "Mark"</span>]
</pre>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> keep the original order of the names in the output.</p>
