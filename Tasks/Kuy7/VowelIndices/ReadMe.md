<h2>7 Kuy</h2>
<hr>
<p>We want to know the index of the vowels in a given word, 
for example, there are two vowels in the word super (the second and fourth letters).</p>
<p>So given a string "super", we should return a list of <code>[2, 4]</code>.</p>
<pre>
Some examples:
Mmmm  => []
Super => [2,4]
Apple => [1,5]
YoMama -> [1,2,4,6]
</pre>
<h3>NOTES:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Vowels in this context refers to: a e i o u y (including upper case)</li>
<li>This is indexed from <code>[1...n]</code> (not zero indexed!)</li>
</ul>
