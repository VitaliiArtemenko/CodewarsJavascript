<h2>7 Kuy</h2>
<hr>
<p>In this Kata, you will be given an array of integers whose elements have both a negative and a positive value, 
except for one integer that is either only negative or only positive. 
Your task will be to find that integer.</p>
<h3>Examples:</h3>
<pre>
[1, -1, 2, -2, 3] => 3  // 3 has no matching negative appearance
[-3, 1, 2, 3, -1, -4, -2] => -4   // -4 has no matching positive appearance
[1, -1, 2, -2, 3, 3] => 3   // 3 has no matching negative appearance
</pre>
<p><b>Note:</b> the only-positive or only-negative integer may appear more than once</p>
