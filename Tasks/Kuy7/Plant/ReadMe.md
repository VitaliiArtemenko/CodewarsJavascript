<hr>
<p>You have cultivated a plant, and after months of hard work, the time has come to reap the flowers of your hard work. When it was growing, you added water and fertilizer, and kept a constant temperature. It's time check how much your plant has grown.</p>
<p>A plant is represented horizontally, from the base to the left, to the end to the right:</p>
<pre>---@---@---@</pre>
<p>The stem is represented by hyphens <code>-</code>, and the flowers are represented by symbols. A plant always starts with the stem, and always ends with flowers.</p>
<p>Four parameters will be given. The four parameters are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>seed</code> (string) - <i>determines the type of flowers generated by the plant.</i></li>
<li><code>water</code> (integer) - <i>each unit of water extends the portion of stem between the flowers. It also gives how many times the stems + flower clusters should be repeated</i></li>
<li><code>fert</code> (integer) - <i>each unit of fertilizer increases the amount of flowers, grouped in clusters</i></li>
<li><code>temp</code> (integer) - <i>if the temperature given is in the range of 20째C and 30째C, the plant grows normally, otherwise, all the flowers die except for one flower at the end of the stem.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Given the above parameters, your task is to return a string representing the plant.</p>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<pre>
plant(<span style="color: green">'@'</span> <span style="color: darkorange">3, 3, 25</span> ) => <span style="color: green">'---@@@---@@@---@@@'</span>
<span style="color: grey"><i>
# Water gives the length of the stem portions between flowers
# Water also gives the total number of segments(number of times flowers + stems should be repeated)
# Fertilizer gives the length of the flower clusters.
# Temperature is in the range of 20째C and 30째C</i>
</span>
plant(<span style="color: green">'$'</span> <span style="color: darkorange">4, 2, 30</span> ) => <span style="color: green">'----$$----$$----$$----$$'</span>

plant(<span style="color: green">'&'</span> <span style="color: darkorange">1, 5, 20</span> ) => <span style="color: green">'-&&&&&'</span>

plant(<span style="color: green">'^'</span> <span style="color: darkorange"> 3, 3, 35</span> ) => <span style="color: green">'---------^'</span>
<span style="color: grey"><i>
// The temperature is not in the correct range, so all flowers die, except the last one at the end.
// The stem is not affected by the temperature
</i></span>
</pre>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Edge conditions will not be tested, meaning parameters of water or fertilizer or temperature being zero. This will not be tested. The parameters will always be valid (no zero).</li>
<li>The temperature bounds are inclusive (20 and 30 will be included as 21, 22, 23, 24...)</li>
</ul>
