<p>Your goal is to return multiplication table for <code>number</code> that is always an integer from 1 to 10.</p>

<p>For example, a multiplication table (string) for <code>number == 5</code> looks like below:</p>

<pre>
1 * 5 = 5
2 * 5 = 10
3 * 5 = 15
4 * 5 = 20
5 * 5 = 25
6 * 5 = 30
7 * 5 = 35
8 * 5 = 40
9 * 5 = 45
10 * 5 = 50
</pre>

<p>P. S. You can use <code>\n</code> in string to jump to the next line.</p>

<p>Note: newlines should be added between rows, but there should be no trailing newline at the end. 
If you're unsure about the format, look at the sample tests.</p>
