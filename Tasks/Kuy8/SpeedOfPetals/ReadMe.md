<h2>8 Kuy</h2>
<hr>

<p>When it's spring Japanese cherries blossom, it's called "sakura" and it's admired a lot. 
The petals start to fall in late April.</p>

<p>Suppose that the falling speed of a petal is 5 centimeters per second (5 cm/s), and it takes 
80 seconds for the petal to reach the ground from a certain branch.</p>

<p>Write a function that receives the speed (in cm/s) of a petal as input, and returns 
the time it takes for that petal to reach the ground <b>from the same branch</b>.</p>

<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The movement of the petal is quite complicated, so in this case we can see 
the velocity as a constant during its falling.</li>
<li>Pay attention to the data types.</li>
<li>If the initial velocity is non-positive, the return value should be <code>0</code></li>
</ul>
