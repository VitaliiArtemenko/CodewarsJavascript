<p>In this kata you will have to write a function that takes <code>litres</code> 
and <code>pricePerLitre</code> (<strong>in dollar</strong>) as arguments.</p>
<p>Purchases of 2 or more litres get a discount of 5 cents per litre, purchases of 4 or more litres get a discount of 10 cents per litre, and so on every two litres, up to a maximum discount of 25 cents per litre. But total discount per litre cannot be more than 25 cents. Return the toal cost rounded to 2 decimal places. Also you can guess that there will not be negative or non-numeric inputs.</p>
<h3>Note</h3>
<p>1 Dollar = 100 Cents</p>
