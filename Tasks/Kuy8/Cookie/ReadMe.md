<h2>8 Kuy</h2>
<hr>

<p>For this problem you must create a program that says who ate the last cookie. 
If the input is a string then "Zach" ate the cookie. 
If the input is a float or an int then "Monica" ate the cookie. 
If the input is anything else "the dog" ate the cookie. 
The way to return the statement is: "Who ate the last cookie? It was (name)!"</p>
<p>Ex: Input = "hi" --> Output = "Who ate the last cookie? It was Zach! 
(The reason you return Zach is because the input is a string)</p>
<p>Note: Make sure you return the correct message with correct spaces and punctuation.</p>
