<p>Your task is to find the first element of an array that is not consecutive.</p>

<p>By not consecutive we mean not exactly 1 larger than the previous element of the array.</p>

<p>E.g. If we have an array <code>[1,2,3,4,6,7,8]</code> then 1 then 2 then 3 then 4 are all consecutive 
but 6 is not, so that's the first non-consecutive number.</p>

<p>If the whole array is consecutive then return null</p>
